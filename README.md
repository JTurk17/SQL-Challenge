# SQL-Challenge

For this challenge I needed to look up DATE data types for SQL tables so that I could then filter for employees with a hire date in 1986 for the second query. 

1. https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_dates.asp
   - General information about DATE datatype.
  
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9891025/sql-select-from-column-where-year-2010
   - Used the code towards the bottom of the webpage to filter for the year
